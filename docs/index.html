                <p>You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation. This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.</p>

                <p><b>Purpose of the study: </b>This is a study on how the looks of an application effect learning and how this effect may differ across different ages. The goal is to find any features of a design that are better or worse for learning, and to see if what works for adults is the same as what works for children.</p>

                <p><b>Procedures to be followed: </b>This study will take approximately twenty minutes to complete. The study consists of two phases: a learning phase and a testing phase. During the learning phase you will be presented with a series of color-number associations, and in the testing phase you will be tested on your ability to recall and apply these associations by being presented with a number or color and responding with the associated number or color.</p>

                <p><b>Risks to study participants: </b>This study causes no foreseeable risks.</p>

                <p><b>Benefits to research participants and others: </b>You will not directly benefit from the study. The field of games for teaching children may benefit from the results of this study.</p>

                <p><b>Record keeping and confidentiality: </b>No identifying information will be recorded. The results of your participation in the study will be recorded in a secure database.
