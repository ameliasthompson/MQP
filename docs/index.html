This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.</p>

                <p><b>Purpose of the study: </b>This is a study on how the looks of an application effect learning and how this effect may differ across different ages. The goal is to find any features of a design that are better or worse for learning, and to see if what works for adults is the same as what works for children.</p>

                <p><b>Procedures to be followed: </b>This study will take approximately twenty minutes to complete. The study consists of two phases: a learning phase and a testing phase. During the learning phase you will be presented with a series of color-number associations, and in the testing phase you will be tested on your ability to recall and apply these associations by being presented with a number or color and responding with the associated number or color.</p>

                <p><b>Risks to study participants: </b>This study causes no foreseeable risks.</p>

                <p><b>Benefits to research participants and others: </b>You will not directly benefit from the study. The field of games for teaching children may benefit from the results of this study.</p>

                <p><b>Record keeping and confidentiality: </b>No identifying information will be recorded. The results of your participation in the study will be recorded in a secure database.
