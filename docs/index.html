                <p>This is an experiment on the impact of user interface on learning. Participation is not mandatory, and you may revoke your consent to participate and have data collected on your trial at any time by closing the window. No data will be saved until consent is reconfirmed following the conclusion of the trial. All data collected is anonymous and will not be released.</p>

                <p>The experiment consists of two phases: a learning phase and a testing phase. During the learning phase you will be presented with a series of color-number associations, and in the testing phase you will be tested on your ability to recall and apply these associations by being presented with a number or color and responding with the associated number or color.</p>

                <p style="color: red">If you are a minor, you will need a parent or guardian to provide consent in your stead.</p>
